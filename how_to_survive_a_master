here's some thoughts about my life(i.e. research) as well as skillsets and mindsets for a (computer graphics) master student in szu.

I.why these exist?
Out of the a few advices that I found helpful from my advisor"research should be logical."writing logically is the one that I've always 
wanted to try,but stuck with the emptyness in my head. Now since I've came to a milestone where I came to szu as a cg master student, it's 
a good opportunity to write more,even if it's not my paper.
I intended this to be something to update from time to time.

II.time management


III.reading paper
