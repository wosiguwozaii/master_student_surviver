here's some thoughts about my life(i.e. research) as well as skillsets and mindsets for a (computer graphics) master student in szu.

I.why these exist?
Out of the a few advices that I found helpful from my advisor"research should be logical."writing logically is the one that I've always 
wanted to try,but stuck with the emptyness in my head. Now since I've came to a milestone where I came to szu as a cg master student, it's 
a good opportunity to write more,even if it's not my paper.just write something.
I intended this to be something to update from time to time.
An enormous part of a master student life is undoubtedly to learn different techniques dedicated for an ultimate problem.For most,especially
for beginners, a puzzling thing is the huge amount of existing practices that you might need to get familiar with.If you just glimpse through
them, you might be frustrated by the subtle differences among them. As a master student, it's your duty to at least get familiar with these
different technologies but sometimes, you find yourself burried by some technical details, or you find something too easy to grasp while
overlooking its importance.

II.time management
